# Gator

Gator is a command-line RSS feed aggregator and reader written in Go. It allows users to register, follow/unfollow feeds, fetch and browse posts, and manage their subscriptions, all backed by a PostgreSQL database.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Add, follow, and unfollow RSS feeds
- Fetch and store posts from feeds
- Browse posts from followed feeds
- Periodic feed aggregation
- Command-based interface
- Persistent configuration and session management

## Requirements

- Go 1.24.4 or later
- PostgreSQL database
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) for generating database access code

## Setup


1. **Install with Go:**
   ```sh
   go install github.com/kevvarlar/gator@latest
   ```


2. **Configure the database:**
   - Create a new PostgreSQL database called `gator` by running:
   (Linux/WSL)
     ```sh
     sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE gator;"
     ```
   (Mac)
   ```sh
   psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE gator;"
   ```
   - Set the `db_url` in your config (see below).

3. **Get the migration files:**
   - Download or clone the migration files from the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/kevvarlar/gator.git
     # Or download just the sql/schema directory from the repo
     ```

4. **Run database migrations:**
   - Use [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) or your preferred migration tool:
     ```sh
     goose -dir sql/schema postgres "$DB_URL" up
     ```

4. **Generate Go database code (for development only):**
   ```sh
   sqlc generate
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run Gator from anywhere:
```sh
gator <command> [arguments...]
```

## Configuration

Gator uses a JSON config file stored at `~/.gatorconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/gatordb?sslmode=disable",
  "current_user_name": "yourusername"
}
```


You can set the current user with the `login` command.

## Commands

- `register <username>`: Register a new user
- `login <username>`: Set the current user
- `addfeed <feed_name> <feed_url>`: Add a new feed and follow it
- `feeds`: List all feeds
- `follow <feed_url>`: Follow an existing feed
- `unfollow <feed_url>`: Unfollow a feed
- `following`: List feeds you are following
- `browse [limit]`: Show recent posts from followed feeds (default limit: 2)
- `agg <duration>`: Periodically fetch new posts (e.g., `agg 10m`)
- `reset`: Delete all users (admin/dev only)
- `users`: List all users

## Database Schema

- **users**: Stores user accounts
- **feeds**: Stores RSS feeds
- **feed_follows**: Many-to-many relationship between users and feeds
- **posts**: Stores posts fetched from feeds

See `sql/schema/` for full schema definitions.
